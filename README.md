## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Variables
- CSS Flex
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Decided on CSS Flex layout for this challenge
- Took into consideration that this code would just be a component and not a stand alone page. Apllied styles to classes that could be easily copied and re-used in already established code for a page or app.
- Need to figure out how to get the violet overlay onto the image.
